3 P's 4/8/2025 Week 10
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
Continued editing my written product and digital product, I also tried to integrate some feedback into my code but that has been slow.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I don't think I have anything I'm stuck on at the moment, I was trying to use Maxent modeling but was having trouble getting it to work.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I want to continue to polish my digital product, and start working on my presentation as well. Also I think using a model like logistic regression as a baseline might be useful.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I think around 15+ hours.

3 P's 4/1/2025 Week 9
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
Finished the first draft of the digital product, cleaned up some code and tested out alternate modeling methods and data import functions for cleaner code.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I don't think I have anything I'm stuck on at the moment.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I hope to continue working on alternate modeling methods as well as cleaning up the current random forest method I have. Potentially exploring state data as well could be a way to improve upon the current model.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I think around 25+ hours.

3 P's 3/25/2025 Week 8
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I completed the written product, I also completed a smoother way to import data into R for analysis (more testing required). Finally I started laying out my digital product in Arc StoryMaps.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I don't think I have anything I'm stuck on at the moment.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I want to complete the digital product, I also hope to make some tweaks to my modeling and data processing methods in order to create an accurate model.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I think around 30+ hours.

3 P's 3/18/2025 Week 7
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I spent some time compiling the rest of the variables I thought were relevant to my project. I also had a meeting with the city to get some clarity on what type of output they're looking for, and the overall process they go through when listing a species as invasive which was helpful. Finally I began a rough draft of my written product.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I don't think I have anything I'm stuck on at the moment.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Obviously I want to have my written product complete, I also want to explore the ArcGIS story maps as a digital product outlet potentially. 

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I think around 20 hours or more.

3 P's 3/11/2025 Week 6
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I scheduled a meeting with the city, also cleaned up the github repo and polished the modeling code up. I started to work on a data import R file but that is not a big priority right now.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I don't think I have anything I'm stuck on at the moment.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I want to work on visualizing the model output, and start an outline for the written product. If I have time I want to go over my data cleaning/prep steps with the spatial analysis lab to ensure I'm avoiding any bias or over fitting of the model.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I think around 15 hours this week.

3 P's 3/4/2025 Week 5
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I managed to finally tack on the layers I need for each data point in my dataset, now I can easily add/remove any variables from the set. This was what was holding up much of my project so it should be relatively smooth now (knock on wood). 

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I think the only problem I have currently is just some feedback on things the city might want out of the model. This of course is solved by meeting with them again.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I hope (schedule permitting) to meet with the city to get some feedback on what they would like to see out of the model or if they have a baseline they like to use. It would also be good to confirm what data sources they use (if not internal).

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
Had some longer hours in this one, probably around 20 hours.

3 P's 2/25/2025 Week 4
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I was able to manually add soil data into my model, I also tinkered with connecting to the montana state data library to avoid having to download and move files manually.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
Currently I am stuck on how to import data in for modeling, at the moment I can manually download the file and import that data that way. But I think it's possible to connect to the Montana Spatial Data Infrastructure (MSDI) which should allow me to pull in layers easily but I think I need a login to do that.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I want to manually download soil, land cover, and precipitation data for modeling purposes. For the moment I think i'm better off doing that until I can figure out a way to use an API/other source to pull in data. Again I need to try to meet with the spatial analysis lab on Thursday to get a better understanding of that process, as well as model refinement.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
Probably around 10 hours, slightly less.

3 P's 2/18/2025 Week 3
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I've mapped out which layers I need to add to my model and I've gotten into ArcGIS Pro which will give me the ability to visualize the model output. Also continued playing around with the basic logistic regression model I created, adding pseudo-absence points to my data that allow me to train the model on more than just locations where there is Russian Olive.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
No significant problems at the moment, I think just adjusting to ArcGIS is the most significant hurdle.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I want to have a basic visualization completed by next weeks post, at this point I'm just doing habitat suitability modeling so it should be fairly simple to map once the models complete.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I would estimate around 10 hours or so.

3 P's 2/11/2025 Week 3
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I have made a very basic version of the model I hope to complete. I am also working to clean up some of the testing code I already have to adhere to the R style guide.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I think one thing I need to really refine is what results I want to get out of the model, I am also waiting to hear back from my client to see if they have any feedback on that.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I hope to continue refining the model I created, I also want to meet with the folks at the spatial analysis lab again.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
Had a slower week so probably around 10. 


3 P's 2/4/2025 Week 2
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I have successfully imported all data I need for my modeling efforts, also have begun exploring options for modeling. I think to start I want to use logistic regression in order to test out variables and ensure it's working properly. I have also determined my client contact with the ecology extension, and met with someone at the spatial analysis lab who can be a helpful resource for any modeling questions I have.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I think clarifying what outcomes the ecology extension is interested in, which I am in the process of doing. Also figuring out what environmental variables are important to my model.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I hope to have a basic model completed by next weeks post, whether it's logistic regression or random forest or another. I also want to clean up some of my initial code and decide on an R style guide.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I would say around 15 hours again (maybe slightly more).

3P'S 1/28/2025 Week 1
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
As this is the first post, I have almost finished collecting all the data I need for my modeling efforts. I also completed some basic testing of importing data and using some new packages I am not familiar with.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I'm not stuck on anything yet.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I intend to meet with someone at the Spatial Analysis lab to help continue my research into the best way to approach this type of modeling (R, Python, or other). In the meantime I will continue testing on Python as that is what I have gotten to work so far.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
Since last week I would say I worked on it for around 15 hours or so.
