3 P's 2/11/2025 Week 3
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I have made a very basic version of the model I hope to complete. I am also working to clean up some of the testing code I already have to adhere to the R style guide.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I think one thing I need to really refine is what results I want to get out of the model, I am also waiting to hear back from my client to see if they have any feedback on that.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I hope to continue refining the model I created, I also want to meet with the folks at the spatial analysis lab again.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
Had a slower week so probably around 10. 


3 P's 2/4/2025 Week 2
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I have successfully imported all data I need for my modeling efforts, also have begun exploring options for modeling. I think to start I want to use logistic regression in order to test out variables and ensure it's working properly. I have also determined my client contact with the ecology extension, and met with someone at the spatial analysis lab who can be a helpful resource for any modeling questions I have.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I think clarifying what outcomes the ecology extension is interested in, which I am in the process of doing. Also figuring out what environmental variables are important to my model.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I hope to have a basic model completed by next weeks post, whether it's logistic regression or random forest or another. I also want to clean up some of my initial code and decide on an R style guide.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I would say around 15 hours again (maybe slightly more).

3P'S 1/28/2025 Week 1
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
As this is the first post, I have almost finished collecting all the data I need for my modeling efforts. I also completed some basic testing of importing data and using some new packages I am not familiar with.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I'm not stuck on anything yet.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I intend to meet with someone at the Spatial Analysis lab to help continue my research into the best way to approach this type of modeling (R, Python, or other). In the meantime I will continue testing on Python as that is what I have gotten to work so far.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
Since last week I would say I worked on it for around 15 hours or so.
