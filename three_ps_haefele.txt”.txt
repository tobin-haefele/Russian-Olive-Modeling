3 P's 2/11/2025 Week 3
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I have made a very basic version of the model I hope to complete. I am also working to clean up some of the testing code I already have to adhere to the R style guide.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I think one thing I need to really refine is what results I want to get out of the model, I am also waiting to hear back from my client to see if they have any feedback on that.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I hope to continue refining the model I created, I also want to meet with the folks at the spatial analysis lab again.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
Had a slower week so probably around 10. 


3 P's 2/4/2025 Week 2
o Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?
I have successfully imported all data I need for my modeling efforts, also have begun exploring options for modeling. I think to start I want to use logistic regression in order to test out variables and ensure it's working properly. I have also determined my client contact with the ecology extension, and met with someone at the spatial analysis lab who can be a helpful resource for any modeling questions I have.

o Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I think clarifying what outcomes the ecology extension is interested in, which I am in the process of doing. Also figuring out what environmental variables are important to my model.

o Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
I hope to have a basic model completed by next weeks post, whether it's logistic regression or random forest or another. I also want to clean up some of my initial code and decide on an R style guide.

o How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?'
I would say around 15 hours again (maybe slightly more).
